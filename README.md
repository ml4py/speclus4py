This package is related to unsupervised learning using [the spectral clustering technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering). It is written in the Python programming language on top of the [SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es) and [PETSc/TAO](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) frameworks, and it includes many others additional packages like [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org), [numpy](https://numpy.org), [numba](http://numba.pydata.org). It takes advantages from distributed memory management, which basically inherits from PETSc. Thus, computations can run on parallel computing architectures such as [beowulfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster)/small clusters and [supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) natively. It does not mean that one cannot use it on laptops and desktop computers. On these, users can effectively utilize computational cores using the message passing interface commonly known as [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) as well. This approach provides distributed data parallelism to the conventional machine learning technique and enables it for possible processing [large-scale data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data). 


This repository contains the alpha pre-release of the speclus4py package. Do not hesitate to pull a request if you find a bug or have an idea how to extend a package functionality.

## Installation

You can simply install spelus4py using the package management systems [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

```bash
conda create -n env-speclus4py python=3.7
conda activate env-speclus4py
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --append channels conda-forge/label/gcc7
conda install -c mpecha speclus4py
```

## Getting Started

Take a look at [Usage](#usage) and the examples located in the *demo/* folder to your first meeting with this package, which might accelerate using spelus4py in your research. You can run the example of 2-phase segmentation of *data/vol_imgs/ball.vti* (volumetric image) by simply typing to a system console a following command that runs a computation on two CPU cores:

```bash
export WORK_DIR=$PWD
mpirun -np 2 python demo/ex1.py 
``` 
If this package was succesfully installed, you can see the result as *a green ball* displayed in a visualization window.

## Usage

The best way to see how speclus4py can help to your research is looking at the *demo* folder.

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

from speclus4py import SPECLUS as clustering
from speclus4py.tools import hdist_2phase

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
solver = clustering.solver(comm=comm, verbose=True)

filename = 'data/vol_imgs/ball.vti'

solver.filename_input = filename
solver.sigma = 0.05  # setting value of standard deviation related to RBF kernel
# number of nearest neighbours to those similarities are being computed
solver.connectivity = 6  

solver.setFromOptions()

# Determine the Hamming distance between solution and ground truth
if comm.Get_rank() == 0:
    labels = solver.getLabels()
    if labels is not None:
       hdist_2phase.hdist_2phase_vol_img(filename, labels, verbose=True)

```
